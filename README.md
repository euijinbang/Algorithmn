### Insertion Sort

Pick a key form unsorted part.

Compare the key to its predecessor.

If the key is smaller than its predecessor, move the greater elements one position up,

until key becomes greater than one of the (decreasing index)predecessors or go till the end.(to start)

Then, place the key in the correct position.
